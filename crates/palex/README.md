# palex

A fast, small, dependency-free crate for lexing command-line arguments. You
can use this crate if you want to build your own argument parsing library.

This crate is almost zero-cost, since it parses arguments lazily and avoids
most heap allocations. There's no dynamic dispatch.

## Usage

Palex isn't published on crates.io yet, but it will be soon!
